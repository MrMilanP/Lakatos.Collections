# Lakatos.Collections

## Overview
**Lakatos.Collections** is a C# library designed for developers who need advanced data structures focusing on immutability and persistence. This library aims to simplify working with immutable collections while offering version history and safe, consistent operations.

### Why Lakatos.Collections?
Unlike the standard collections in .NET like `ImmutableList`, **Lakatos.Collections** provides advanced persistence, allowing you to maintain versions of your collection over time. This can be highly beneficial for scenarios where data integrity, consistency, and history tracking are crucial.

## Collections Available
- **PersistentList**: A linked list where each modification (like adding a new element) results in a new version of the list. All previous versions remain accessible, ensuring historical consistency without data mutation.

## Features
- **Immutability**: Like the built-in `ImmutableList`, collections from **Lakatos.Collections** do not allow modifications in place, which helps avoid side effects in your applications.
- **Version History**: Track changes and maintain historical versions of your data. Useful for undo features, historical data viewing, and concurrent system safety.
- **Efficient Snapshots**: Only the difference is stored, allowing multiple versions without memory blow-up.

## Practical Use-Cases
- **Undo/Redo Operations**: Implement undo/redo functionality in applications effortlessly.
- **Time-Travel Debugging**: Enable the inspection of how data structures change over time.
- **State Management**: Particularly useful in multi-threaded or distributed systems where you want a consistent snapshot at any point in time.

## Getting Started
### Installation
Install via NuGet Package Manager:

```shell
Install-Package Lakatos.Collections
```
## Example Usage

```csharp
using Lakatos.Collections.Persistent;

var persistentList = PersistentList<int>.Empty;
persistentList = persistentList.Add(1);
persistentList = persistentList.Add(2);

// Accessing previous versions
var previousList = persistentList.Previous; // Will be [1]
```

## Comparison to Other Immutable Collections

| Collection     | Average Insertion Time | Historical Tracking | Complexity  |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| PersistentList | ~7 µs                  | Yes                 | Logarithmic |
| FSharpList     | ~3 µs                  | No                  | Linear      |
| ImmutableList  | ~127 µs                | No                  | Linear      |

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- **Immutability and Safety**: No accidental modifications of data, which makes the code easier to debug and maintain.
- **Persistence**: Track the evolution of data over time, enabling undo/redo functionality and version control-like behavior.

### Cons
- **Memory Usage**: Persistent collections can consume more memory, as each change creates a new version of the data.
- **Speed**: Slower than some non-persistent collections due to version handling, especially when dealing with a high volume of modifications.

## Advanced Features
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Provides the capability to step back in time and see previous states of the collection, useful for debugging complex application states.
- **Concurrent Operations**: Due to immutability, these collections are inherently thread-safe, making them useful for concurrent applications without synchronization issues.

## Practical Scenarios for Use
- **Undo/Redo Functionalities**: Useful for text editors, drawing apps, and anywhere where reverting operations are needed.
- **Data Flow Systems**: In systems where data passes through many transformations, immutable collections help track and validate every stage.
- **Multithreaded Applications**: When multiple threads need to access a collection without risk of corruption or race conditions.
